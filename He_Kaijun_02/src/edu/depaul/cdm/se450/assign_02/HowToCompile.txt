I'm using intellij idea, so for my project, i just need to 
change arugment in edit configuration, 
for example >java HelloRunner 6
it will pop up some sentences in terminal and user has to type
in some name, then it will pop out hello messages.
and if type in >java HelloRUnner or >java HelloRunner 0,
an error message will be out in terminal
